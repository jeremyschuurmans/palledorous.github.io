Vim is a powerful text editor that can help you write code faster and more efficiently than you ever thought possible. That is, once you learn how to use it, which is notoriously difficult to do. The reason for this is because Vim is not a graphical text editor (like Atom, for instance). You can't click on a file and navigate to it, or click a line of code to edit it. To do anything in Vim, you have to learn a set of commands that are unique to the editor. The effort is well worth it, though, because when you get the hang of it, Vim is not only really powerful, but really fun to use.

If you have ever installed and experimented with Vim, you'll know that one of the first struggles people have is figuring out how to exit the editor. This problem is so commonplace, it has practically become a meme in the programming world. So, if you ever find yourself in that situation,

To exit Vim:

1. If you are in edit mode, first press the `<Esc>` key.
2. Then enter `:wq + <Enter>` to save and exit.

To exit without saving, you can run 
`:q! + <Enter>`
