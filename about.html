<p>I love writing clean, simple code, and writing about code and life. I approach JavaScript with fear and trembling. Oh, and tacos. I love tacos. This website is my blog for the Flatiron School community. You can find my main blog at dev.to/jeremy, though much of the content will be the same, and my main website at jeremyschuurmans.com. <a href="#">Test link</a></p>
