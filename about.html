<p>I love writing clean, simple code, and writing about code and life. I approach JavaScript with fear and trembling. Oh, and tacos. I love tacos. This website is my blog for the Flatiron School community. You can find my main blog [here](https://dev.to/jeremy), though much of the content will be the same, and my main website [here](https://jeremyschuurmans.com).</p>
