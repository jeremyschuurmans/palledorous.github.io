<p>I love writing clean, simple code, and writing about code and life. I approach JavaScript with fear and trembling. Oh, and tacos. I love tacos. This website is my blog for the Flatiron School community. You can find my main blog <a href="https://dev.to/jeremy">here</a>, though much of the content will be the same, and my main website <a href="https://jeremyschuurmans.com">here</a>.</p>
